After creating the pleasures series, there were just a few things that still did noy satisfy/ I was happy with most of the buttons, but there were a few details that still bothered me.


Rather than create new packages for each modification and improvement, it made sense to have 1 directory with the pixmaps, and just include the textfiles for the themes. It means that you may have a few extra pixmaps, but overall the download size is reduced

magic night is apparantly a mod of playbillblue

A couple of pixmaps from AXONCOLORS are included, as much as I would love to use the topbar image for active windows there is something that  creates a transparant hole between the titlebar and application any time I try to use it. The menu bar seems to work, see the beautiful mind theme.

These themes use non standard, but open source fonts available from google (arimo and droid), mozilla (fira) and kde.org (oxygen)

It should be easy to replace these with your own favorites, a couple of commented options are included

I use a lot of kde apps, and the oxygen style, this window style works nicely with those colors as well as looking nice with a variety of darker themes.

there are a few extra pixmaps in the theme dir, did not see the need to remove them, and they may be useful for your own mods


have fun
