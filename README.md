Config files and pekwm themes
----------

Goals:
-------------

Clean, consistant look

 - easily distinguish between overlapping windows (PekWM)
 - easily distinguish between active and inactive windows (PekWM)
 - window resizing without fighting to grab edge of window (just right border width) (PekWM)
 - try to reduce number of fonts required in system
	(fira, or arimo for theme), 
	(hack, and oxygen are used in some other configs)

Additional Goals:
-------------

Clean, well layed out (I hope) configuration files.
hopefully others can easily modify and learn from these files.

(Use a monospace font when editing for easily viewed layout)
