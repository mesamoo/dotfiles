Config files and pekwm themes

Goals:
Clean, consistant look
    easily distinguish between overlapping windows
    easily distinguish between active and inactive windows
    window resizing without fighting to grab edge of window
    reduce wasted space while retaining readability
    reasonably nice appearance with light or dark gui
    look nice with or without compositing
    try to reduce number of fonts required in system 
    (fira, or arimo for theme), 
    (hack, dejavu and oxygen elsewhere but working to reduce )
    
    
These themes have been designed using a monitor resolution of 1920x1280. Some editting may (will) be required for lower resolutions. (Reduce fonts by about 6 points for 1024x768 resolution) Reduce title height by same amount. Reducing title height may require scaling some buttons as well.
