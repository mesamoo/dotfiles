Config files 
----------
(Themes are in separate reopsitories)

Goals:
-------------

Clean, consistant look

 - try to reduce number of fonts required in system
	(fira, or arimo for theme), 
	(hack, and oxygen are used in some other configs)

Additional Goals:
-------------

Clean, well layed out (I hope) configuration files.
hopefully others can easily modify and learn from these files.

(Use a monospace font when editing for easily viewed layout)
