vtwm Theme setup and information:

==============================================================================
Define your X resolution:
    The themes tarball supports resolutions "1024x768",
    "1280x960" and "1680x1050" The resolution you use
    should be set in export variable $JMC_XRESOLUTION.
    For example, put

       export JMC_XRESOLUTION="1280x790"

    in your .profile if you use 1280x790.  Or in .login

       setenv JMC_XRESOLUTION "1280x790"

    if not set, will assume 1024x768

==============================================================================
Initial run:

    When you un-tar it, it will create subdirectory '.themes_vtwm'.
    To start out, save your copy of .vtwmrc somehwere and execute

      ~/.themes_vtwm/bin/get_vtwm.sh theme

    where 'theme' is the theme you want to use.  After this
    there will be a menu for the themes inside the new
    ~/.vtwmrc.

==============================================================================
Changes you may want to do:

    1. you may need to change theme_matrix "VTWM Profile"
       for root window set.  nexpm is needed for theme_matrix

    2. if you want to use a different directory than
           ~/.themes_vtwm/
       you should do a search for "themes_vtwm" in all
       files and change it to what you want it to be.
